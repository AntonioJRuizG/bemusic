## Info

Final project of a great fullstack web development bootcamp in which I participated ðŸš€

The goal is not just to develop the application, but also to collaborate with classmates and implement best practices.

The following screenshots of the Jest coverage file and the SonarCloud project summary show the challenge of ensuring code quality by eliminating bugs and code smells, achieving 100% test coverage and 0% code duplication through unit testing and CI/CD tools.
